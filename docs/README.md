## Introduction

A Zsh ZI annex (i.e. an extension) that provides functionality, which allows to:

1. Run programs and scripts without adding anything to `$PATH` via the automatic creation of **links** in `$ZPFX/bin`

## Install linkbin

Simply load like a regular plugin, i.e.:

```zsh
zi light z-shell/z-a-linkbin
```

After executing this command you can then use the new ice-mods provided by
the annex.
